I took at C++ Course at Fresno City a couple semesters ago. Our final project was a line editor. 

The program prompts the user to create or open a .txt file. 
From there, the user can view the contents of the file. Each line of the text file is numbered. 
The user can choose to add lines, replace lines, delete lines, insert lines, copy lines, and paste lines. 
The user can also save the file and end the program.
